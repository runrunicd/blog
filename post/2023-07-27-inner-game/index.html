Now I find that life seemingly has no inherent meaning; the meaning of life seems to be in learning how to give it meaning. Finding meaning in everything requires cultivating a certain ability.

<p>The calendar years 2022 - 2023 are the milestones for my spiritual growth. I feel and see that there are two systems. The visible one is created by human beings over ages, where everyone sort of finds a path to follow. This path is designed with rules. The second world is invisible, but I feel that it is grander and is related to the reason why I came into this world.</p>
<h4 id="-the-meaning-of-life">ðŸ”– The Meaning of Life<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-the-meaning-of-life">#</a></h4>
<p>In the past, I was always contemplating the meaning of life, wanting to find a task or career to pour my passion into. Now I find that life seemingly has no inherent meaning; the meaning of life seems to be in learning how to give it meaning. Finding meaning in everything requires cultivating a certain ability. I&rsquo;ve felt a lot of things; I can&rsquo;t help but think. I want to embrace painful experiences to learn something, knowledge that isn&rsquo;t found in books. I read, I think, I understand, and I discover that the ancients have already written about their insights and knowledge. One day, I had a dream where I was burrowing into an onion, peeling its layers one by one, only to find out that there was no core. I was startled; I felt like I had touched the void, but the next minute I suddenly realized that I love life.

In an instant, the feeling of boundless emptiness compressed to the present moment, and an epiphany about cherishing the present suddenly arose!</p>
<p>Back in the real world, pain arises from the subjective judgments of gains and losses; if the present moment is the only reality, giving meaning to it, if we can constantly refine ourselves to convert each moment into some form of &lsquo;gain,&rsquo; whether external or internal, then life will become increasingly expansive.</p>
<h4 id="-the-relationship-between-knowledge-and-wisdom">ðŸ”– The Relationship Between Knowledge and Wisdom<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-the-relationship-between-knowledge-and-wisdom">#</a></h4>
<p>Knowledge is the projection of wisdom. Wisdom comes from the God through gifts - the experiences and reflection.</p>
