      <description>Here, I&amp;rsquo;m documenting snippets of my conversations with my wish about a 10-year vision. In Chinese, ÂõæÂõæÂæê‰πã.
üîñ ‚òØÔ∏è The growth in life is a process of integrating yin and yang. It is constantly changing, balancing, and integrating. What facilitates true growth in life? Pain and love.

Both have shed light on the concept of building systems that encourage growth and resilience. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating how everything starts with a simple framework ignited by a spark; it then gains momentum and expands through garnering support, optimization, and evolution.
Take, for example, the process of scaling a business from the ground up. It often starts with a minimal viable product (MVP) built by an entrepreneur.</description>

      <description>Messy &amp;hellip; Introduction to Large Language Model Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data, followed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF).
Training methodology is simple but is limited to a few players with high computational requirements
