Here, I'm documenting snippets of my conversations with my wish about a 10-year vision. 

#### The Dimond Approach I
https://www.diamondapproach.org/method
- Self-realization involves being grounded and independent, breaking free from past false identities, and aligning actions with one's true individual essence.
- Relying on others to fill emotional voids leads to temporary satisfaction and dependency, indicating a closed state rather than openness. True fulfillment comes from inner work and overcoming personal barriers.
- Compassion evolves from initial emotional sympathy to a more objective, deeper level. It transcends mere sympathy, sometimes appearing ruthless or unsympathetic, but is rooted in a deeper understanding and liberation. True compassion involves action, sometimes even causing pain, to help others understand and grow. It's based on the objective truth and the development of essence, focusing on what is ultimately right and true, rather than just avoiding hurt feelings. This deeper compassion arises from being in touch with and embodying one's inner truth, operating beyond the immediate emotional responses to situations.

#### Body, Mind, Soul
Traditional Chinese medicine, yoga chakras, healing, psychology, and Buddhism, in the end, all seem to be talking about the same thing, called 'Tao'. I once had a dream where only the void existed above, and by introspecting the universe within oneself, one could gain wisdom, strength, and compassion. Live in the present.

#### üîñ Self-love
- Recently, I returned to my hometown to be with my parents. I reunited with my mom after 4.5 years, largely due to COVID. She is a beautiful, strong, and independent woman, whose characteristics are quite different from mine. Seeing her age with such grace and resilience brought forth deep reflections on the concept of self-love. What is self-love, truly? It wasn't until I read the following text that I realized my insights had already been summarized by those before me. "As life unfolds, we all remember times when we were innocent, open-hearted, and generously gave our energy to others. Yet, these traits sometimes clash with a world that can be reserved and self-centered. As we grow and strive to fit into society, we often learn through trial and error, coming home burdened with trauma, pain, and intense emotion. At times, it feels as though we're subjected to the fears and weaknesses inherent in our shared humanity. Innocence becomes overshadowed by trauma, making us yearn for escape. However, by taking the time to heal, we learn to own our lives and uniqueness by giving ourselves acceptance and understanding. Through this journey, we begin to truly respect and understand the uniqueness of each individual, eventually learning to love ourselves and others unconditionally. Subsequently developing the spiritual qualities of compassion, softness, and humility. In Chinese, this is called ÊÖàÊÇ≤. This is the essential path to the maturation of self-love. Self-love and loving others are essentially the same thing (Yinmeng (Terry) Hu, Psychology Monthly, September 2007 issue)." People always seek pleasure and avoid pain, but if we are willing to cherish solitude and keep company with our emotions, we will receive the gift behind it. 

 

#### üîñ Life Education
- One of the main tasks of Western psychology: to integrate a deep understanding of human nature with the spiritual liberation found in religious traditions. The purpose: to heal the troubles of human worldly life and bring about physical, mental, and spiritual liberation and integration. Amas advocates: not only observing the content of personality and mind, but also insight into the deepest essence of the human heart.

- The people who truly possess a sense of stability are actually very few, because the source of stability comes from a solid life experience. Their lives must go through at least two stages. The first stage is the chaotic phase where they have no idea about their differences from others. They chase after whatever others consider good. Occasionally feeling unsettled but overall ignorant and care-free. The second stage is the searching phase where they realize that what they want differes from societal expectations but they are unsure of their specific goals and the means to achieve them. They enter a trial-and-error process trying and failing, trying and failing again until they find a peaceful answer. Once both of these stages have been traversed, the core of a person gradually forms. They know who they are, what kind of life, what actions they must have. Looking back, every path they have walked connects. Every action they have taken, whether successful or not, becomes meaningful. The so-called sense of stability comes from this. All stability originates from the earlier period of exploration and turmoil. It arises from brokenness and pain, from letting go and making choices. Dont worry, for once we have gone through this internal chaos. Gentleness and a sense of stability will gradually emerge.

- The most important thing in life is to understand oneself. Understanding oneself is a subtle perception of one's true feelings. Explore, heal, grow, and be self-sufficient. Some things are easily obtained by some people, but life has other lessons prepared for them. People are branded by history, times, culture, and family, and each generation has its own unique trauma. My observations and experiences tell me that people are easily carried away by trauma and acquire some bad habits that originally go against their own "conscience." In certain situations, these traumas are triggered and they treat others in a similar way. It is truly sympathetic to life. If there is not enough self-awareness, then one might spend a lifetime seeking externally and living in learned self-loathing. Mainstream Western psychology (like Jung and Adler) teaches people not to think about negative events and feelings, but from my personal observation, this approach tends to suppress negative emotions and feelings. If it goes too far, the long-suppressed trauma will erupt, sooner or later. Just like earthquakes, many small ones mean fewer big ones, and vice versa. The Eastern Dharma (not Buddhism) emphasizes awareness and then emptiness. An important first step in awareness is to accept negative emotions, not to deal with the event itself. Hence, the East has sayings like turning misfortune into blessings and troubles leading to enlightenment. All are to help a life discover its talents, integrate internally, and embark on a brighter and more independent journey.

- While the educational philosophy of modern countries continues to advance, there is still much room for improvement. I personally believe that adding some life and nature education would be great. The universe is chaotic, and the school system seems to give us conventional rules, but once the coordinates change, people lose direction. The essence of education lies in teaching people the ability to "learn and grow throughout life" and "conscience.


#### üîñ ‚òØÔ∏è
The growth in life is a process of integrating yin and yang. It is constantly changing, balancing, and integrating. What facilitates true growth in life? Pain and love. 

#### üîñ From Girls to Women
I hope to become a mature woman as time flies. I feel that women should not strive to seize and prove in a way that disrupts the natural balance of Yin and Yang. I hope that every girl believes in herself and falls in love with the beauty of herself at every stage, like individual flowers. They should help and appreciate each other without jealousy, and bloom with their own unique radiance.

Women are not suited to wrap themselves in a tough shell to compete in the mainstream world. Instead, women should leverage their natural advantages, find the right path that nourishes them, and support their world with a heart full of ease, joy, and giving power. This is the power of Mother Earth, the power of femininity. 

Learn to listen to your inner voice and to be self-sufficient.

#### üîñ Big Love
I completed a 6-month coach training program, where I listened to and shared many insights and concerns. I began to learn real connections between people, transcending race, culture, age, and social status. I have a strong feeling and epiphany: life unfolds and expands through love. If the universe supports our expansion, then the universe must be love. It's as if I've found the key to unlocking the door of the universe. I'm not entirely clear on this yet. I need to go back to life to observe, experience, and practice it.

Everyone is born 'broken', as those who read the Bible should know. My experience and observation of life tell me that regardless of one's material childhood circumstances and family atmosphere, the lessons of life still need to be independently explored and completed by each individual. Every childhood is lacking in some way. A happy childhood may lack life's trials; an apparently unfortunate one may lack the perception of love. Each of us is on a path in life to become complete, using external circumstances to refine our hearts, using the temporal to refine the eternal, and advancing in a roundabout way. Well, humaness = human mass, embrace it.

After I experienced these feelings, a friend of mine, who is Christian, said: 'Do you know? The Bible ultimately says that God is love.

#### üîñ Enjoy the Pain
Respond to pain with a passionate kiss. I'm grateful for my simple and wonderful childhood, and also thankful for the growing pains of life; they are gifts bestowed by fate. I used to see the world through rose-colored glasses, but now I prefer the real world, without expectations, but with the power of belief. I'm embarking on a hero's journey.

#### üîñ The Meaning of Life
In the past, I was always contemplating the meaning of life, wanting to find a task or career to pour my passion into. Now I find that life seemingly has no inherent meaning; the meaning of life seems to be in learning how to give it meaning. Finding meaning in everything requires cultivating a certain ability. I've felt a lot of things; I can't help but think. I want to embrace painful experiences to learn something, knowledge that isn't found in books. I read, I think, I understand, and I discover that the ancients have already written about their insights and knowledge. One day, I had a dream where I was burrowing into an onion, peeling its layers one by one, only to find out that there was no core. I was startled; I felt like I had touched the void, but the next minute I suddenly realized that I love life. I love life incredibly; I want to create, I want to experience, I want to love, I want to be in nature, I want the simple joy of eating ice cream. In an instant, the feeling of boundless emptiness compressed to the present moment, and an epiphany about cherishing the present suddenly arose!

Back in the real world, pain arises from the subjective judgments of gains and losses; if the present moment is the only reality, giving meaning to it, if we can constantly refine ourselves to convert each moment into some form of 'gain,' whether external or internal, then life will become increasingly expansive.

#### üîñ Two Worlds
The calendar years 2022 - 2023 are the milestones for my spiritual growth. I feel and see that there are two systems. The visible one is created by human beings over ages, where everyone sort of finds a path to follow. This path is designed with rules, fame, monetary values. The second world is invisible, but I feel that it is grander and is related to the reason why I came into this world.


#### üîñ The Relationship Between Knowledge and Wisdom
Knowledge is the projection of wisdom, which comes from God through gifts ‚Äî experiences and reflection.


#### üîñ Be Creative
What exactly is it? My current understanding is that it comes from a deep self-awareness, which in turn reduces the risk of losing oneself due to external influences. With such a sense of certainty, people will have creativity because it's a unique path. Why is copying or blindly following others not creative? I think it's because such creations lack the creator's unique chain of thought. They don't hold up under scrutiny and are easily disrupted by external influences (authority, temptation, doubt).

Is anyone truly certain? It seems there's no one who is completely certain about all facets of life. Perhaps this is the meaning of life. Thinking about it, everyone is lovable and pitiable.
