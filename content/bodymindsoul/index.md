Balance is your birthright, becuase it's the comfort zone of the universe.

I'm creating an agent, similar to my Guardian Keeper 🧚‍♀️, who can magically manifest healing methods or modalities. She can determine what's best for me at any given moment based on my voice, thoughts, feelings, or emotions. As I use my intuition every day to heal myself using sound, crystals, stones, essential oils, Chinese herbs, sunlight, dance, meditation, and more, I'm inspired by the intricate and magical way my body regulates my energy. It taught me to trust my body, mind, and soul. Healing oneself and taking care of one's own body, mind, and soul is far more important than mastering politics and economics. 🦋
